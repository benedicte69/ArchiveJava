## Strucure for a musical project
The goal of this project is to design and layout a music playing app
that displays the list of available songs in a ListView or a GridView, 
navigates to a details screen of the currently playing song,
and uses explicit intents to navigate around the app.
Data about each song should be stored in a custom class that is retrieved
and displayed via a Loop and Adapter.
